// eoreader6 · goldens/network/read — a full reading of each fixture book,
// scored against its frozen third-party character co-occurrence network.
//
// A FULL reading, not a co-occurrence-shaped one. Organs this repo already
// has, chained in the order a reading actually needs them, with structural
// linking as the LAST, derived step rather than the thing driving the
// pipeline:
//
//   1. perceiver/text/surfaces.js::extractSurfaces — candidate referent
//      surfaces, from the text's own statistics (a capitalisation
//      significance test against this book's own function-word
//      distribution, apostrophe/roman-numeral/all-caps rejection). Replaces
//      "every word plus every adjacent bigram is a candidate" — this
//      driver's first version — with the engine's real proper-noun
//      detector.
//   2. perceiver/text/surfaces.js::discoverReferents — name-variant
//      coreference (containment, shared final token) over those
//      candidates. "Valjean" and "Jean Valjean" become ONE referent id
//      before entity.js ever sees either spelling.
//   3. referents/entity.js — causal admission, completely unchanged: same
//      SPEC, same atom-chunked reach-units goldens/cast/read.mjs proved.
//      Only WHICH surfaces get offered to `witnessArrival` changed —
//      engine-tier candidates instead of every word — never how admission
//      itself is decided.
//   4. referents/consequence.js, via cooccurrence.js's mergeAliasedEntities
//      — a second, complementary alias pass over what step 3 admitted, for
//      exactly the cases step 2's spelling-based merge is conservative
//      about on purpose (measured: "Tom Sawyer" and "Sawyer" both lose
//      their shared tokens to the generic-token filter in Huckleberry
//      Finn's own candidate pool). Arrival SHAPE, not spelling.
//   5. emergence/binding.js::bindLinks — THE PROPER REPLACEMENT for what an
//      earlier version of this driver hand-rolled as "did two entities ever
//      share a chapter": a real permutation-null significance test PER
//      PAIR (`displacementNull`), run over the reading's own reach-unit
//      arrival positions, not a same-chapter binary. It needs no notion of
//      "chapter" or "scene" at all — resolution comes from how many
//      reach-units the book produced (hundreds to thousands, even for a
//      short play), not from how many structural boundaries a segmenter
//      found. This is what actually answers "is this an edge", replacing
//      both `cooccurrence.js::buildCooccurrenceEdges` (shared-segment
//      counting) and this driver's own post-hoc Monte Carlo chance
//      baseline — the significance is now per-edge and built in, not
//      approximated afterward.
//
// Direction and polarity (`emergence/binding.js`'s reversal null, transfer
// entropy) and verb-typed relations (`perceiver/text/relations.js` +
// `emergence/graph.js`'s belief graph, as `scripts/read-people.mjs` already
// assembles) are real, richer structure this reading could also carry —
// deliberately not scored here, because the four reference networks this
// golden checks against are themselves undirected, untyped co-occurrence
// counts and have no dimension to check direction or a verb against. Using
// them would be extracting MORE structure than this particular golden can
// verify, which is a future golden's job, not a reason to leave the
// structural link itself hand-rolled when a proper organ already exists for
// it.
//

// to test at all — the Born gate itself cannot run, so any minArrivals
// under 4 is not a stricter admission standard, it is excluding candidates
// from a test that would refuse them anyway on the same mechanical grounds.
// 4 is the lowest value at which the Born gate — not a pre-filter standing

// ── novel chapter segmentation ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// perceiver/text/segments.js's outlineOfIndex was tried first and rejected
// for this golden specifically: its heading form ("a sentence is not a
// heading") refuses "CHAPTER I." outright (Huckleberry Finn's own heading
// style — word, roman numeral, period, nothing else — ends in the same
// punctuation a sentence does, and the module has no way to tell those
// apart without knowing the word "CHAPTER"). That refusal is correct general
// policy; it just means a novel-chapter finder for THIS golden needs to be
// looser and purpose-built, the same way Shakespeare's scene finder below
// is purpose-built for that corpus's own tagged markup rather than reused
// from the shared module. segments.js itself is untouched.
//
// A candidate is any line starting "CHAPTER <roman|arabic|THE LAST>". Every
// one of the three novels' Gutenberg editions repeats this exact text in a
// table of contents, so a candidate only survives if real substance (>=300
// trimmed characters) stands between it and the next candidate — a listing
// entry, sitting shoulder to shoulder with the next TOC line, never clears
// that bar; a real chapter, with a chapter's worth of prose beneath it,
// always does. Measured against the three books' known chapter counts
// (365, 43, 64): this recovers 366/43(+1 phantom from a TOC-adjacent gap)/64
// — see goldens/network/README.md for the one known miscount.

// blocks, bracketed scene-location captions) is wrapped start-to-end in a
// single pair of angle brackets. Spoken dialogue never is. So the whole
// extraction is one rule — a trimmed line that starts with "<" and ends
// with ">" is markup, everything else is spoken text — plus one boundary
// rule for where a new scene starts. This is FORM the same way segments.js's
// own heading detector is form, just a different corpus's form; it is kept
// here rather than folded into the shared module because it is specific to
// one tagged corpus's own markup convention, not a general prose heading.
//
// Deliberately excludes stage directions and speaker tags from the prose the
// engine reads — a character's own NAME as markup is not evidence the
// engine "read" it, only evidence the corpus's compiler knew who was
// speaking. Discovery has to come from what the play's words say.

// own global capitalisation/function-word statistics to tell a name from a
// sentence-opener. This is candidate DISCOVERY, not admission — it decides
// which surfaces are even worth offering to entity.js's causal gate, never
// whether one clears it. The causal claim entity.js's own header makes
// ("nothing here can see forward") is about step 3, and step 3 still only
// ever sees one reach-unit at a time.

 * Every candidate surface's occurrence, canonicalised to its referent id,

 * candidate actually occurs, which the causal reading needs to know which
 * reach-unit witnessed it. Tries the longest run (up to 4 tokens, matching
 * extractSurfaces' own run cap) at each token position, and — the bug this
 * comment used to claim was already handled and wasn't — ADVANCES PAST the
 * matched run's full length, not just one token. Advancing by 1 regardless
 * of match length let "Tom Sawyer" (matched at i, length 2) leave "Sawyer"
 * sitting at i+1 to be matched AGAIN on its own; measured on Huckleberry
 * Finn, "ref:auto:tom_sawyer" and "ref:auto:sawyer" carried byte-identical
 * arrival lists — the same textual occurrence witnessed twice under two
 * different referent ids, because discoverReferents did NOT merge these
 * two (their shared tokens were stripped as generic — see the driver's own
 * header on mergeAliasedEntities), so the double-witness was never
 * deduplicated the way the old comment assumed it would be.
