// build-act-prior.mjs — transform VerbNet 3 (NLTK data mirror, verbnet3.zip:
// 325 class XML files, Levin-numbered) into ActPrior@1: every member verb
// FORM mapped to which of the NINE ACTS (the engine's own operators, cube.js)
// its VerbNet class's semantics perform — DR1 of live_priors/goldens/reading/
// DERIVED-RULES.md, built the same one-fetch-one-script way eoreader6.1's
// build-pos-prior.mjs already proved for POS.
//
// THE MAPPING IS A DECLARED TRANSLATION, NOT A DISCOVERY — THRAX_MAP's own
// precedent (eoreader6.1 wordclass.js: UD tags → Thrax's eight, every entry
// naming where the schemes agree and where they do not). Here: Levin/VerbNet
// class semantics → RULE.md Part II's mode×domain question ("what does the
// act do to its object, and where does it operate"). Each row carries a
// one-line because; a family whose classes straddle acts gets exact-class
// rows; a class whose reading is genuinely arguable carries `alt` — P56's
// asymmetric discipline (refusable, never confirmable) applied to acts.
//
// GRAIN IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. RULE.md's own framing: the grain is
// occurrence-level — what THIS transformation lands on — read from the
// clause, never from the verb's type. ActPrior@1 answers the TYPE question
// (which act); phasepost.js's grainOf answers the occurrence question.
//
// AMBIGUITY IS KEPT, NEVER COLLAPSED (POSPrior@1's own discipline): a form
// in classes mapping to different acts lands `contested` with every act and
// its classes listed; phasepost.js treats that as a candidate set.
//
