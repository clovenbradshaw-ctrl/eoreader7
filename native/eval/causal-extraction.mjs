// native/eval/causal-extraction.mjs — what a reader reading IN ORDER extracts,
// against what a batch analyzer with full lookahead extracts.
//
// extraction-overview.mjs calls discoverRelationVocab over the WHOLE text at
// once and extracts every sentence with the resulting vocabulary. That is not
// reading: sentence 12 is extracted using evidence from sentence 9,000.
// READING-POLICY P2 stage 2 states the commitment it violates — a conditional
// null "built only from material already read (groundUpTo never slices
// forward)" — and P1 makes causality the load-bearing rule of the whole
// document.
//
// The causal arm here is the REAL perceiver (createCausalTextPerceiver),
// stepped encounter by encounter in order, exactly as the recursive reader
// drives it: vocabulary refreshes every `refreshEvery` sentences from the
// material read SO FAR, and each sentence is extracted with the vocabulary as
// it stood AT THAT MOMENT — never revisited when later evidence arrives.
//
// The gap between the two arms is the price of causality, and it is a fact
// about this reader worth knowing precisely rather than assuming either way.
//
