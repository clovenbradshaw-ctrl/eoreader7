// native/eval/anchoring-precision.mjs — score descriptor anchoring against
// the committed coreference golden (pg84-frankenstein.coref.json), as a
// NEGATIVE CONTROL.
//
// The golden's creature entry lists the descriptor surfaces that all
// predicate ONE being — "the creature", "the monster", "the wretch",
// "the fiend", "the dæmon", "the being", "the devil", "my creation" — and
// that being is UNNAMED: nested first-person narration means the creature
// never carries a capitalized proper-name surface, so he can never enter
// the cast that anchoring binds against. Therefore EVERY anchoring binding
// of a creature descriptor to a named referent is a FALSE binding, by the
// golden's own annotation — a precision instrument that needs no judgment
// call. (Scoped surfaces — "my enemy"/"my adversary", weight 0.7, valid
// only inside declared narrator spans — are excluded: applying them
// without resolving their spans would score the mechanism against a truth
// this driver did not actually compute.)
//
// What this measures: of every creature-descriptor OCCURRENCE the text
// carries, how many did anchoring (correctly) refuse or leave unoffered,
// and how many did it (wrongly) bind — and to whom. What this does NOT
// measure: precision on descriptors the golden does not cover ("my
// father", "the stranger", scene furniture) — those need their own
// annotation, and are reported as uncovered volume, never as "clean".
//
// Also disclosed: anchoring can only pair descriptor ↔ named cast. It can
// never say "the wretch" = "the monster" (descriptor ↔ descriptor
// identity), which is the golden's actual cluster. That absence is the
// mechanism's disclosed shape, not this driver's finding.
//
