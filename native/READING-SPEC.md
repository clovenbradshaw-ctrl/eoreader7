# The reading spec — what constrains eoreader7 development and usage

Binding, in V7-CUT.md's own sense: the compatibility law says 6.1 behavior is
the contract and native paths replace legacy only under conformance. This file
restates the parts of `legacy-eoreader6.1/READING-POLICY.md` (P0–P7, attempt
log A1–A25) that this repo's own work violated in one session, each with the
violation that earned its place here, and the standing rules that came out of
re-learning them. Enforced where mechanical by
`native/conformance/reading-spec.test.mjs`. Amend by appending.

## S1 — The constitutional reader is runnable, and it is the baseline

The reader P0 names — the HOST assembly (`packages/host/corpus.js`:
`createSession` / `admitChunked` / `sessionReferents` = discoveredCast:
surfaces → witnessed referents → pronoun binding → relation vocabulary, with
priors injected) — runs from this repo via
`native/eval/constitutional-read.mjs`. Measured here on Frankenstein with the
language and coref priors injected: 99 referents, 648 pronoun mentions bound /
809 unresolved (typed), 2,925 triples, 25/25 spans byte-verified.

**Rule.** Any claim about what "the reader" does is measured against this
assembly or names precisely which stages it lacks. A native path is not "the
reader" until it reaches stage parity under conformance; until then it is an
assembly with a name and a stagesNotRun list. (P0: "any claim about 'what this
system can do' must name the assembly it was measured on." Earned: this
repo's native path was reported as the reader while missing P2 stages 4–8.)

## S2 — A prefix is a different material, not a smaller one

`discoverRelationVocab` recurrence is a whole-book statistic and COLLAPSES
under truncation (Dracula whole: 135 recurring; at 7%: 3). No mechanism may be
justified by a sliced measurement; a truncated run says `truncated: true` at
the point of the claim. (P5.5 — the driver, not the theory. Earned: three
claims retracted in `native/eval/results/vocabulary-scale-FINDING.md`.)

## S3 — Lookahead is not reading

A driver that derives state over the whole text and then scores every unit
with it has read sentence 12 using evidence from sentence 9,000. Such numbers
are LOOKAHEAD BOUNDS and are labeled so. The causal arm is the real reader,
and its difference from the bound is a finding, not an error (measured:
causal finds MORE link forms and FEWER arrangements). (P2 stage 2: "built
only from material already read — `groundUpTo` never slices forward.")

## S4 — Accumulation is the direction; re-grounding is the documented posture; parity gates the swap

Recall is retrieval over what the Fold holds, and the honest grain is one
proposition — slowness there is an incremental-algorithm defect, never a
license to coarsen (measured: the re-scanning refresh made the
one-proposition grain cost 16× and made batching look necessary). BUT the
6.1 perceiver's periodic re-ground is not an accident: attempt A11 records
it as the design ("the helix does not stream — it re-grounds"), and an
early sentence re-read under a matured closed class is part of the behavior
the compatibility gates certify. Measured here, the hard way: replacing the
re-ground with strict accumulation lost Walton from Frankenstein's cast and
the CI gate caught it — the "more causal" rewrite was a different reader
wearing the name. **Rule:** the accumulate-only reader is real future work
and lands ONLY behind conformance parity with the constitutional read
(cast, bindings, relations); until then `kernel/activation.js` (decay,
dmdWindow) stands as the tested organ, unwired into the perceiver, and the
perceiver's re-ground stays.

## S5 — Activation decays; the rate is measured, not set; length is not reach

Decay belongs to the kernel — losing activation is a property of anything
read in time (language, music, video), not an NL heuristic. Gamma is derived
from a window (`gammaFor(w) = 1 − 1/w`, tiers.js's own derivation) and the
window is found by the difference that makes a difference
(`kernel/activation.js::dmdWindow`): the shallowest depth at which forgetting
everything older changes no conclusion, with `reach_exceeds_candidates` as a
typed gap — never a silent fall-back to the widest. Two refusals guard the
two old mistakes: never enlarge a window to fix recall (P1.1, attempt A4),
and never derive a window from material LENGTH (the engine's own eight-file
refusal: "the reach of the present is never derived from material length" —
dmdWindow derives from material BEHAVIOR, which is a different claim, made
explicit). `window: null` is the disclosed undecayed control arm, never a
silent default meaning.

## S6 — The kernel never speaks a medium's grammar

An arrangement has ends, not parts of speech. The kernel takes participants
by ordinal position; `role` is caller-declared annotation the kernel never
interprets. Any kernel read of role names like "subject"/"object" is the
dependency inversion V7-CUT forbids (`spec ← kernel ← adapters`) — measured:
composition and kind-structure went dark on everything a text adapter had
not labeled, "not because the structure was absent but because nobody wrote
'subject' on it." SVO, verbs, and word adjacency live in
`adapters/text/relations.js`, which is "medium-specific by construction" —
and P6 already names that: "text is the special case." Grammar priors REFUSE
candidates and never admit them (P3: "never patch a missing prior by
loosening an engine gate").

## S7 — Priors are injected and stated; their absence is stated too

Every reported run names which priors were injected. A run without the coref
prior is a result about an unprimed reader and says so. (P3, verbatim policy.)

## S8 — Read the attempt log before attempting

READING-POLICY's append-only attempt log exists so dead ends are not
re-entered. This session re-entered several (window-derivation shape ≈ A4's
territory, slice measurement ≈ P5.5, SVO-as-reader ≈ A17/P6). The standing
rule: before building any reading mechanism in this repo, check P0–P7 and
A1–A25 for the prior attempt; cite the entry when building on or departing
from it. New refuted attempts are appended there (or here, when v7-specific),
never merely fixed in silence.
